/**
 * Element-level form association. `<web-multiselect>` is a form-associated custom
 * element (`static formAssociated = true`); core's `BlissElement` exposes the
 * associated <form> via the public `el.form` getter (lazily attaching
 * ElementInternals). This is the surface host frameworks depend on: Phoenix
 * LiveView's `phx-change` delegation resolves the parent form through
 * `event.target.form`, which is `undefined` on a custom element without this
 * getter. See the v2 regression where `internals` went `#private` and the
 * wrapper's `.form` polyfill (reading the old, accidentally-public field) died.
 *
 * jsdom does not wire real form association (`ElementInternals.form` is always
 * undefined), so the happy path is modelled by stubbing `attachInternals`.
