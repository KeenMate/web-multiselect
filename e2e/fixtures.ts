/**
 * Shared Playwright test fixtures for the web-multiselect e2e suite.
 *
 * Import `test` / `expect` from here instead of `@playwright/test`. The only
 * addition is an always-on guard that **fails any test in which the page threw
 * an uncaught error** (`pageerror`) — the class of failure that let the
 * compact/partial "no options" crash sail through a green suite, because it
 * surfaced only as an uncaught exception during a page's init script and nothing
 * asserted on it.
 *
 * The listener attaches during fixture setup — before the test body's first
 * `page.goto` — so it catches load-time and init-script errors too.
 *
 * Opt out (for a test that deliberately provokes an uncaught error): read the
 * injected `pageErrors` array and clear the entries you expect, e.g.
 *
 *     test('...', async ({ page, pageErrors }) => {
 *         // ...trigger the expected throw...
 *         expect(pageErrors).toHaveLength(1);
 *         pageErrors.length = 0; // consumed → the guard passes
 *     });
 */
